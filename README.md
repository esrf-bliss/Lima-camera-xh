# LImA

Lima ( **L** ibrary for **Im** age **A** cquisition) is a project aimed at the unified control of 2D detectors. The aim is to clearly separate hardware-specific code from common software configuration and features, such as setting standard acquisition parameters (exposure time, external trigger), file saving and image processing.

Lima is a C++ library which can be used with many different cameras. The library also includes a [Python](http://python.org) binding and provides a [PyTango](http://pytango.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) device server for remote control.

- **lemo_out** <- Lemo can be set as single integer value, or multiple values, value is mapped to the lemo output. Mapping is done using binary coding, where 2 bits are used for single output. When multiple values are provided binary OR is calculated and corresponding outputs are then activated. LEMO7 is reserved for the orbit trigger.

    Per group enables for the 8 Lemo outputs. These are binary coded 0..65535, using 2 bits per LEMO output. Bits 1..0 for LEMO0, bits 3..2 for LEMO1 â€¦ bits 15..13 for LEMO 7. For each output, currently 0=> do not pulse output in this frame, 1 => do pulse output in this frame, 2..3 => reserved for future expansion.

    By default set to `[65535]`.

    > Example:

        xstrip timing setup-group "xh0" 0 200000 3 500 frame-delay 300 lemo-out 65535 aux-delay 250 aux-width 50

        xstrip timing setup-group "xh0" 1 100000 3 500 frame-delay 300 lemo-out 1|4096|16384

    The first group sets lemo-out 65535 which enables currently all 8 outputs during this group. Group 1, lemo-out 1|4096|16384 enable outputs 0, 6 and 7. Group 2 enables outputs 0, 2, 6 and 7 etc.

### Software Trigger Generation

For InternalTriggerMulti, the software trigger is set by the software. It sets `m_software_trigger` to true and acquires as many frames as set. Once the last one is grabbed, it disables the software trigger by setting `m_software_trigger` to false.

### Frame Acquisition

Setting the timing group is executed in `prepareAcq()`. We need to set up the timing group before acquisition. If we plan more than one group, the last of them needs the "last" keyword at the end, which is implemented inside `prepareAcq()`.

> It could also be set in `startAcq()` for every trigger, but this would make sense only in the case of having one group. In that case, we can have just one group with id = 0 and "last" at the end, and set it for the first trigger only.

Lima must have a frame number set before acquisition. So, if we need 25 frames, we ask like "loopscan(25, exposure_time, xh_lima)".

If we have more than one group, the number of frames is multiplied. Every group will have the number of frames set in the setup timing group. So, having 5 groups with 5 frames each results in 25 frames in total.

Once Lima knows the number of frames collected, if you would like to have more than one group, then the number of frames set will be divided by the total number of groups.

> So, if you have 5 groups and set "loopscan(25, exposure, xh_lima)", it will result in having 5 frames acquired in every group, but still 25 in total.
